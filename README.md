## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/Scrap Proprties.png)

This project is a Python web scraper designed to extract sale listings data from the ForSaleByOwner website. By utilizing web scraping techniques, the scraper automates the process of gathering valuable information from the website, such as property details, pricing, location, and contact information.

## Built With

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

Requests: for making HTTP requests and retrieving HTML content.
CSV: for handling the data export functionality.
Prettytable: To show text on the terminal in tabular form.
pyinputplus: To get input from the user and validate it.

* [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [PrettyTable](https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/)
* [Pyinputplus](https://pypi.org/project/PyInputPlus/)

Now select slugs by index number let's select slugs `new-your` by passing index `1`.

Now it will ask to delete the previous csv file data if you have already. As you setting it up first time so you will not have any csv just chose `Yes` by passing `a`.

The scraper will then navigate through the ForSaleByOwner website, extracting the relevant data and saving it to a CSV file. The extracted data can be easily accessed and analyzed using various data manipulation tools and techniques.
