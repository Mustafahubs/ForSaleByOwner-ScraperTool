## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/Scrap Proprties.png)

This project is a Python web scraper designed to extract sale listings data from the ForSaleByOwner website. By utilizing web scraping techniques, the scraper automates the process of gathering valuable information from the website, such as property details, pricing, location, and contact information.

## Built With

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

Requests: for making HTTP requests and retrieving HTML content.
CSV: for handling the data export functionality.
Prettytable: To show text on the terminal in tabular form.
pyinputplus: To get input from the user and validate it.
